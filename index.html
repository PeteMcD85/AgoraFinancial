      <p>I'm going to show you...</p>
      <ul class="check-box">
        <li>
          How a class of “off-limit” gold stocks could become fair game and
          shoot up in price…
        </li>
        <li>
          Why just as many gold stocks could be CRUSHED. But this isn’t a bad
          thing. In fact, it’s going to open up a unique opportunity not seen in
          years…
        </li>
        <li>
          How it could compound an announcement from the Federal Reserve next
          week that could send physical gold prices much higher…
        </li>
        <li>
          Why you’ll hear predictions of doom for the gold market (it’s
          important you understand the truth and know the real profit
          opportunity that’s being set up)...
        </li>
        <li>
          Why we may see confirmation that gold will make a run at $2,000 sooner
          than anyone thinks...
